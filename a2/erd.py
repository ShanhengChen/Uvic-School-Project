#  * [name] a name (unique identifier)
#  * [attributes] an unordered list of attributes that are a property *of the relationship*
#  * [primary_key] an unordered sublist of those attributes that are necessary to fully define the primary key of this relationship

#   * [parents] an unordered list of names of any entity sets that are parents of this entity set in an IsA relationship
#   * [supporting_relations] an unordered list of (non-IsA) relationship names that partially define this entity set
